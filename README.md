# Discord Collectibles Archive

An easily viewable archive of the various collections, or profile items, found on Discord

## What Are Collectibles?

Collectibles seems to be what Discord classifies as avatar decorations and profile effects that was added as a new feature on [October 12, 2023](https://discord.com/blog/avatar-decorations-collect-and-keep-the-newest-styles). Collectibles are commonly found and purchased within the Discord shop which you can find by going to your _Discord User Settings_ -> _Profiles_ -> Click _Go to Shop_. Occasionally, Discord seems to release collectibles such as avatar decorations during events albeit temporary. These temporary collectibles doesn't get listed in their API once removed as well as expired collectible collections.
